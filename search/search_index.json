It is not to punish workers but to keep them safe. To whom does it apply It applies to the following interprovincial and international industries relevant to us: This is found in the canada labour code section 2 subsection (b) Telephone and telegraph systems; CLC Section 2 part (b) federal work, undertaking or business\u2002means any work, undertaking or business that is within the legislative authority of Federal Parliament, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, (b) a railway, canal, telegraph or other work or undertaking connecting any province with any other province, or extending beyond the limits of a province, Duties and responsibilities Both parties have duties to uphold to comply with the regulations, these are detailed later but in summary here. The employer Employers must take reasonable steps to protect workers from hazards. Employers must provide workers with information and training about health and safety risks. Employers must consult with workers on health and safety matters. Employers must investigate and address health and safety concerns raised by workers. Employers must provide a clean workplace. The employee Employees must use safety materials, equipment, and clothing as prescribed and follow safety procedures. Employees must take reasonable precautions to ensure their own safety and the safety of others. Employees must cooperate with any person carrying out a duty under this Part. Employees must report any hazards or accidents to the employer. Employees must report any situations they believe to be a contravention of this Part by the employer, another employee, or any other person. The employees rights under the code The right to know The employees have the right to be informed of known or forseeable hazards in the workplace. The employees have the right to information, training, instruction and supervison to ensure their safety. The employees have the right to be able to access this information in a way that is appropriate for their needs. The employees are given acccess to government or employer reports regarding the health and safety of of employees. This however does not grant access to medical records without the consent of the person who's medical records they are. The right to participate Employees have the opportunity to be chosen as health and safety representatives or committee members. These employees have the right and the responsibility to participate in identifying and correcting job-related health and safety concerns. Work place health and safety committees must be established in work places where there are 20 or more employees. At least half of the committee members must be employees who do not have managerial functions. This is set for 20 and up to 300 employees and this is where IMS falls. All members that represent the employees will be chosen by the employees through a vote. Members who represent management will be selected by the employer. Part II of the Canada Labour Code further provides for employee participation through the use of an internal complaint resolution process. The right to refuse dangerous work An employee, at work, has the right to refuse dangerous work if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that: A condition exists at work that presents a danger to himself or herself; The use or operation of a machine or thing presents a danger to the employee or a co-worker; and The performance of an activity constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee. In order for an employee to be protected by the Code when exercising the right to refuse, the employee must follow the proper procedure which begins by going to their supervisor. What penalties are imposed for not following the code? Not following the law as set out makes you liable to these if you are found to have contravened them willingly. Quote General offenses, but also applies to death or injury or risk of death or injury mentioned in subsections 2 or 3. 148 (1) Subject to this section, every person who contravenes a provision of this Part is guilty of an offense and liable. (a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years, or to both; or (b) on summary conviction, to a fine of not more than $100,000. Injunctions If it is deemed that these penalties will not solve the issue then the minister of labor may seek an injunction. An order can be made to restrict or restrain the operations of a person or business if they are found to be violating the legal right of another to a safe work environment Quote a judicial order that restrains a person from beginning or continuing an action threatening or invading the legal right of another, or that compels a person to carry out a certain act, e.g., to make restitution to an injured party. What if the employer or employee acted in good faith? The government does provide for this in section 148(4) with exceptions but the burden of proof is on the employer or employee to prove that they acted in good faith. Quote (4) On a prosecution of a person for a contravention of any provision of this Part, except paragraphs 125(1)(c), (z.10) and (z.11), it is a defense for the person to prove that the person exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. However, no person is liable to imprisonment on conviction for an offense under any of paragraphs 125(1)(c), (z.10) and (z.11).","title":" Part 2 of the labor code"},{"location":"Canada%20labour%20code%20part%202.html#canada-labour-code-part-2","text":"","title":"Canada labour code part 2"},{"location":"Canada%20labour%20code%20part%202.html#the-purpose-of-the-code","text":"The purpose of Part II of the Canada Labour Code is to prevent work place related accidents, injury and occupational diseases.

The flash is immediate, but the results can cause severe injury. Flame injuries Flame injuries occur when an arc flash ignites an individual\u2019s clothing, and electrical current may or may not pass the skin in these cases. Lightning Injuries Lightning injuries, involving extremely short but very high voltage electrical energy, are associated with an electrical current flowing through the individual\u2019s entire body. They are injuries caused by lightning strikes; they result from three factors: -Electrical damage. -Intense heat. -The mechanical energy which these generate. While sudden death is common because of the huge voltage of a lightning strike, survivors often fare better than victims of other electrical injuries caused by a more prolonged application of lesser voltage. True electrical injuries True electrical injuries involve an individual becoming part of an electrical circuit. The effect of this type of electrical injury depends on the amperage of the current, the pathway, the state of the body and the duration of exposure to the current.

This standard is written to define the stability and strength requirements of portable ladders that are intended to be used by one person under normal conditions. The regulation refers to portable ladders which fall into the category of temporary structures. These temporary structures are defined by the standard as a ladder that can be readily moved or carried and usually consists of side rails joined at intervals by steps, rungs, cleats or rear braces. Ladder groups Ladders covered by the standard are organized into two groups which are determined by their structure and how they are supported while in use. Single ladders are supported by a structure like a building or pole and include: - extension ladders - combination ladders. Extension Ladder as defined by the standard A non-self-supporting portable ladder consisting of two or more sections travelling in interlocking rails, guides, or brackets so arranged to permit length adjustment. Step Ladders are supported by an opposing ladder section and include: - trestle ladders; - extension trestle ladders; - platform ladders; - step stools; - combination ladders. Step Ladder as defined by the standard A self-supporting portable ladder, non-adjustable in length, having flat steps and hinged back.

Standards Standards are produced by voluntary organizations, such as the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). When standards are published by these organizations, they do not have the power of law. They represent \u201cgood practice\u201d and are viewed as guidelines. However, if a standard is adopted by legislation, then that standard becomes part of the law, and it becomes enforceable. Guidelines Guidelines are documents that help explain how to follow the law. They usually don't have the same power as laws. The canada labour code The Canada Labour Code is a document containing labor laws in the Canadian federal jurisdiction.

Worker safety. Road user safety. Mobility and accessibility. Communication and positive guidance. Consistency and uniformity. Constructability. The overall risk is greatly reduced by proper planning by keeping these and other factors in mind. Each work zone should be predictable and familiar to motorists. Motorists should be able to follow along and not have to react in unfamiliar environments. To apply these principles, a traffic control plan which conforms with legislated and road authority requirements should be developed before any work is performed. Plans Traffic protection plan This is a detailed plan developed for controlling traffic in a work zone and is required under the regulation for construction projects. This plan is a general plan to protect workers exposed to vehicular traffic. ``` Section 67 # O. Reg. 213/91: CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (4) Every employer shall develop in writing and implement a traffic protection plan for the employers\u2019 workers at a project if any of them may be exposed to a hazard from vehicular traffic. O. Reg. 145/00, s. 21. Employers must develop a traffic control plan before work begins when their employees may be exposed to vehicular traffic. This plan should be regularly reviewed and assessed for a safe work environment. This will focus on protecting the worker performing their work and contain the means of protection employed. This will implement protections in all areas of their work. Workers must be trained in the procedures used to protect the workers. The traffic plan must also meet the following requirements, detailing the hazards and protections and shall remain on site for inspection. ``` Section 67 # O. Reg. 213/91: CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (5) The traffic protection plan, (a) shall specify the vehicular traffic hazards and the measures described in subsection (2) to be used to protect workers; and (b) shall be kept at the project and made available to an inspector or a worker on request. O. Reg. 145/00, s. 21. The traffic protection plan comes from the Ontario construction regulations. An effective plan Includes the delegation of responsibilities and training standards and: - Lists PPE requirements. - Details procedures for inspections. - Details safe work practice and procedures. Traffic control plan This is a plan detailing the specific work zone in question. It will list and account for things like speed limits, visible obstructions. It will also have detailed information on the plan to control traffic in that work zone. This is where traffic layouts will also be used to plan the work zone and layout. It will be kept on site and be reviewed and modified as needed. Developing a traffic control plan Pre work evaluation First a pre site evaluation should be done to take in to account the following. - Cross section geometry of the road and space. - Sightlines and the impact on stopping distances. - Operating and posted speeds. - Volume of traffic, consider time of day and nearby areas with busy times like schools. - Existing traffic control devices and proximity of signals. - Accommodation of vulnerable road users. - Non traffic hazards like bridges or medians. - Visibility obstructions. - others. Speed management There are several methods to assist with reduced speed limit compliance up to and including police presence. Table 3.8 and 3.9 lists methods and their effectiveness. Pedestrians Plan to protect pedestrians from exposure to the work zone. Safely replicate as closely as possible the original path placing signs in advance of the work area. If it is determined that work may put pedestrians in danger on the public way it is important to install proper protection. ``` Section 65 # O. Reg. 213/91: CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS public way. 65. If work on a project may endanger a person using a public way, a sturdy fence at least 1.8 metres in height shall be constructed between the public way and the project. O. Reg. 213/91, s. 65. #### Cyclists (book 7 - 3.7.2) Cyclists should be planned for if they have a legal right to access the area the work zone is in. Their presence should be planned for with signage that indicates alternate routes without intruding into their paths. Accommodating cyclists can be done with the following. 1. Converting the road to a shared roadway. 2. Diverting cyclists to an alternate path. 3. Detouring cyclist traffic. Alternate paths should consider their mode of travel, loose gravel or uneven roads are not suitable for them. Overhead obstructions should also be avoided. Avoid closing cyclist lanes and having cyclists dismount wherever possible. #### Reversals within the work area Work within the work area must try to eliminate reversing if possible. If it is not a plan should be made to ensure the safety of workers when a reversal is needed to take place. We should always try to reverse into driveways because reversing out is a far greater risk to comply. ``` Section 104 # O. Reg. 213/91 **104.** (1) Every project shall be planned and organized so that vehicles, machines and equipment are not operated in reverse or are operated in reverse as little as possible. O. Reg. 145/00, s. 27. Night time provisions Use of night garments listed in the OSHA regulations should be used when working at night. Section 69.1 # O. Reg. 213/91: CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (4) In addition, a worker who may be endangered by vehicular traffic during night-time hours shall wear retro-reflective silver stripes encircling each arm and leg, or equivalent side visibility-enhancing stripes with a minimum area of 50 square centimetres per side. O. Reg. 145/00, s. 23. All vehicles must be equipped with four way flashers and amber 360 degree beacons. Work zone lighting Adequate lighting should be used that is placed in a way so it will not blind oncoming motorists. Anti-glare screening Used when working under limited lighting conditions and protects motorists from headlights used to light a work zone. these should not be used in winter because of drifting snow. Additional considerations Drivers will not plan for delays unless warned ahead of time. Our work is intermittent and very short duration. proper active warning should be give to drivers to ensure they are prepared to stop. It is important to not confuse drivers and give clear instructions as to what to do with adequate time. Workers should remain in the work zone and if it in needed to work in the traffic lanes then preparations should be made in the planning stages to ensure safety of the workers. Routinely schedule inspections during different parts of the day to ensure as conditions change the plan is still effective. page 16 Roadway environment Highway A general term for public ways transporting pedestrians or vehicular traffic. Roadway The part of the highway designed for the vehicular traffic, this does not include the shoulder or berm (path or frass strip by the road). Cross sections This refers to the numbers of lanes and may be physically divided or undivided. Freeway This is a highway with the following criteria and must meet all. At least four lanes with two in each direction and a dividing median between the two directions. fully controlled access through interchanges. A speed limit of 90km/h or more. Exclusions to these exist when road authorities, based on the speed and or volume of traffic on the roadway designate it a freeway. Traffic volume Low volume roads have a volume of less than 3000 vehicles per day. To determine the number of cars count the cars for 3 minutes and multiply the amount by 1000. Low volume is less than nine per three minute span with high volume traffic being greater than a nine vehicles per minute span. Rural v Urban Considerations differ greatly between rural and urban work areas. In Rural areas you have less space, obstructions to visibility, traffic that is vehicular and pedestrian to consider. On the other hand urban areas have less obstruction, greater visibility, fewer pedestrians but will also see higher speeds. Configurations for temporary conditions This refers to the physical area requirements for the temporary work zone describing complexity and intrusion. Off-shoulder May take place in right of way but work will not intrude into the shoulder of the roadway. Shoulder Work on the shoulder but not on the travelled lanes. Lane encroachment Workers etc are located on the roadway and this occurs when the lane is reduced to less than 3 meters from the center line. Partial lane shift When one lane is realigned (not closed but moved) to reroute traffic around the work area. Lane closure Used to redirect traffic by closing off a travelled lane. Detours Any diversion from normal traffic that cannot be accommodated in the existing roadway. Rolling closures Often used in short duration work this can involve the use of police vehicles, crash trucks or sign trucks to control speed or temporarily prevent vehicles from entering the work area. Component areas for temporary conditions Areas This comprises the entire area that the work will be performed in and includes several other areas within. Advance warning area An area used to inform motorists of upcoming road work. This is where the work ahead sign will be placed. Approach area the area used to inform drivers of the upcoming traffic flow changes, it may be an arrow or a sign indicating the lanes will merge ahead. Transition area At the beginning of the transition area it needs to be made obvious to the motorists what they should do with the placement of traffic control devices like cones or barrels. This area must be free of obstruction and personnel. Longitudinal buffer area This is a zone to allowing braking between the transition area and work area and should be kept clear of all obstruction. Work area This is where the work is performed and should be setup to minimize hazards and distractions. Termination area Where traffic is redirected back to normal flow. Additional considerations in component area design Ingress and egress Linear space restrictions If space is not available to comply with book 7 for recommended area lengths then modifications may be needed. This may require extra traffic control devices or traffic control persons. Urban low speed area May contain closely spaced intersections, driveways or entrances. Modification to the component areas of a typical layout must be approved by the appropriate road authority. Freeways This may occur on interchanges and the tapers or LBA can be modified to compensate. Horizontal and vertical clearance Workers and their equipment should remain inside the delineators or cones at all times. All horizontal work above ground must also be contained so as not to encroach above or in a live lane. Make sure that ladders do not cross the cones and keep the ladder on the right side of the truck. Work durations There are now 5 categories of work duration in book 7. Mobile operation. Work that is done with frequent stops or at a slow place. The second a boot hits the ground it becomes intermittent duration. Intermittent duration new This is work for 15 minutes or less. very short duration This is from 15 minutes up to 30 minutes. short duration This is work setup from 31 minutes to less than 24 hours. Long duration. This is a work zone setup for more than 24 hours.","title":"The design of traffic control"},{"location":"TC%20Design.html#the-principles","text":"An effective work zone shall be designed to reflect the following principles.

Devices used for channelization, guidance and information serve several purposes. The devices used should effectively Alert motorists of upcoming changes. Separate traffic from the work area. Channelize road users from the normally travelled area. Delineating roadway alignment. Produce specific and desired behaviors in roadway users. Ensure a smooth and gradual transition by providing understandable and effective device placement. Channelizing Devices Cones, construction markers and flexible drums Used to warn, guide or direct and produce specific behaviors like speed reduction. Barricades and barriers Used as a supplement to separate they are mostly used in long duration work. Temporary pavement markings and delineators They are used to guide through the work zone, they must connect at the start and finish with the original road markings. * Orange temporary pavement markings should be used primarily on highways with normal posted speed of 90 and above km/h.* Delineators normally mounted on posts or barriers and provide long range night time visibility. Types Positive guidance Signs should be used in way to display information in an easy to understand manner. They should also be placed to allow drivers time to react or take an alternate route if needed. Regulatory These are signs that are legally enforceable. Road closed is an example of one. Warning Signs These signs generally signal a change in traffic flow due to work being performed. Guide signs These typically inform drivers about things like detours and can also contain information about upcoming road work to be performed. Portable variable message signs Digital display signs used in constructions zones. They should provide advance warning of traffic flow modifications in an accurate and timely manner. Flashing arrow boards Conspicuous signs that guide traffic flow. Used in a wide variety of construction zones and can also act as a barrier. Speed display Effectively reduces speed as it is displays real time vehicle speed to oncoming traffic. Flashing lights While they are not to be used in conjunction with PVMs they can effectively draw attention to hazards, obstructions or signs. Dynamic messaging signs Signs that are usually mounted on an overpass that display LED messages to traffic below. Highway advisory radio and road information telephone service. Both radio and telephone services are used to communicate road conditions, weather delays or other traffic related information. Regulation and controlling It may be needed to implement traffic control procedures and devices when guidance and information devices are not enough. Traffic control persons A traffic control person may be used to either stop traffic or maintain the flow of traffic when lanes must be alternated for use of traffic flow. Selecting a traffic control person. The person should be in good physical condition with satisfactory hearing and vision. Displays mental and physical alertness. Shows mature judgement and a pleasant manner. Should be able to judge the speed of distance of oncoming vehicles and assess the danger if present. Should be able to explain directions, hazards and answer questions from drivers if necessary. Likes, understands and respects the job. Compliance with the OSHA requirements. Preferably a drivers license. Requirements Traffic control persons (or TCPs) are not to be used on consecutive days. The worker will be selected by the employer or supervisor because they are a competent worker. A competent worker is someone who is competent in the specific job they are tasked to do. The TCP must be completely focused on the task at hand. This means: - The supervisor delegates only the task of controlling traffic while working. - The TCP is fully focused on the task assigned and not involved in other tasks like reading emails on their phone. The TCP is positioned in a manner that eliminates or keeps to a minimal the danger from traffic. The TCP will be given adequate written and oral instructions in a language he or she understands with respect to directing traffic and those instructions shall include a description of the signals to be used. In addition the written instructions must be kept onsite at the project. The TCP will be trained in the hazards and controls of directing traffic. This instruction must be presented in language that is understood by the worker and shall include the signs to be used along with their care and maintenance. Preparation for each job Know the following 1. the type of job 2. the type of equipment to be used 3. How the equipment will be operating and where it is planned to travel. 4. Whether you have to protect workers who are setting up components of the traffic control system such as signs etc. 5. Any special conditions of the contract governing road use. 6. How traffic will flow and how it will affect visibility or flow, in this case it may be decided that two people are needed to counter blocks to visibility. Sometimes a third person may be needed to help communicate and keep both TCPs visible. What to check each day Make sure the stop/slow sign meets requirements. Place the traffic control person ahead sign (TC-21) at an appropriate point to give enough warning. remove or cover all traffic control signs at quitting time or when traffic control is temporarily suspended. Make sure breaks are pre arranged. PPE To give drivers the best possible warning the TCP must be as visible as possible. They must also be protected from potential harm by wearing appropriate and CSA approved equipment. A hard hat that meets requirements. CSA certified grade 1 safety boots. CSA approved safety glasses. A vest that covers the upper body in fluorescent or international orange color with two vertical yellow stripes on the front and back and two diagonal yellow stripes in an 'X' pattern. The stripes must be fluorescent and retro reflective and in good condition to reflect the maximum light. Nylon vests must have a tearaway feature, usually achieved with velcro. Signs Specific to the TCP STOP/SLOW PADDLE: Traffic control persons typically use a handheld paddle sign with two sides: one side displaying the word \"STOP\" in red and the other side displaying the word \"SLOW\" in orange. The paddle should be at least 450mm (18 inches) in diameter. The pole holding the sign should be 1.2 m long. The sign should be on a material with at least the rigidity of plywood that is 6mm thick. LETTERING: STOP: Should be printed on high intensity white white at least 150mm high. SLOW: Printed in black at least 120 mm high. BACKGROUND: STOP: High intensity retro reflective red. SLOW: High intensity retro-reflective micro prismatic florescent chartreuse with a black diamond shaped border at least 317x317. Position and location Stand 10 meters from the first taper, away from the work zone and not toward it. Visibility to incoming traffic should be 150 meters. The TCP should stand off the roadway and facing traffic. Do not stand on the travelled portion of the roadway and always face oncoming traffic Stay alert for traffic in front and construction vehicles behind. Stand alone so that there are no distractions. Stand, do not sit so motorists can see you. Be proactive and react to ongoing conditions, make sure you can see traffic and are visible from at least 150ms. Always plan for and be aware of escape paths if a car does pass through. By implementing active advance warning this may change and you may find yourself blocked, always remain proactive about escape routes. Obstacles in the environment When doing the assessment of the area to perform work in, obstructions should be considered between the two TCPs. Hills and curves may require a third person as a mediator between the two. Consider also the 150m rule and the distance from tapers to make sure communication will be effective. (page 176 of book 7) How should signaling be done Hand signals. STOP : Raise your hands 90 degrees to your shoulders and show your palm. SLOW : Show the back of your hand parallel with your wait while pointing toward the sign to motion them through. SIGN : This should be positioned between you and the roadway. Stand off the traveled portion and make the sign visible. give plenty of warning and do not show if too close. When showing the slow sign keep traffic moving and motion them to continue slowly. When showing stop use firm hand signals and indicate where you want the traffic to stop. When traffic has stopped move to a position where traffic in the queue can see you. Make sure traffic in the opposite lane has fully stopped and the roadway clear before turning your sign to slow. step back on the side of the road when traffic is signaled to go. Do not use flags. Stay alert and be clear with your signals. Coordinate efforts with nearby traffic signals to ensure a good flow of traffic. Communication between multiple This should be via a two way radio or preestablished signals. When working together TCPs should always be able to see each other in order to coordinate their signs. An agreed upon signal to change or radio communication should be conducted to make sure they are using their signs in a coordinated manner. Radio communication should be clear and crisp, test before hand. Speech should be short and be clear. Radios should not be used in blasting zones. Where are TCPS not allowed to direct traffic Ontarios constructions project regulation (213/19) 69 (2) A worker shall not direct traffic for more than one lane in the same direction. (3) They shall not direct traffic great than 90KM/H closer than 30 (?) meters from a traffic signal intersection. Rights as a traffic control person Additional requirements under book 7 temporary conditions. Protection from hazards (constructions project regulations(213/91) This involves providing PPE, safety measures and devices designed to protect the TCP. Stop/slow sign The highway traffic act states motorist must obey this sign. - Report dangerous drivers to your supervisor. - Keep a pad and pencil to jot down license plates - Never restrain a motorist or take out your anger on their car, maintain awareness of your exit plan and record the license plate. - Ask for police help in difficult or unusual traffic situations. - Always be alert to emergency traffic. - Working at night (section 4.4.2.2) Reflective materials to be worn must be either: - Retro reflective stripes around each arm and leg. - Equivalent side visibility enhancing stripes. They must also follow the below measures. 1. Wear a hard hat with reflective tape that can bee seen from all angles a minimum of 80cm is recommended. 2. Use a flashlight with a red cone attachment with extra batteries along with the stop/slow sign. 3. The use of amber beacons to enhance advance warning signs. 4. Stand in a lit area lit by temporary lighting, streetlight or a vehicles headlights. do not create a silhouette by being in front of the light. Automated traffic control. Automated flagger assistant devices Has a signal and/or control arm operated by a dedicated TCP who should be close to the device in case of failure. Used typically on two road highways reduced to one. Portable lane closure signals Used to control traffic for short or very short duration work at less than 60km/h in one lane in two traffic. This must only be operated when the contractor is on site. Portable temporary traffic signals Use must be approved by the MTO's reginal traffic office. This device is a moveable pole or trailer with at least one traffic signal mounted on it. Temporary traffic signals This must be approved by submitting drawings to the MTO or road authority. They are traffic signals mounted to a temporary pole or span wires. Signals Automated flagger assistance devices A portable unit with a signal that is remotely operated by a TCP that needs to be close by in case of failure. Used mostly on two lane highways where one lane is closed. Portable lane closure signals They are at least one traffic signal mounted on a moveable pole or trailer. May only be used for one lane of traffic for short and very short duration work. at 60km/h or less and only when the contractor is on site. Portable temporary traffic signals Two standard traffic signal heads are mounted on moveable trailers. These must be approved by the MTOS regional traffic office. Temporary traffic signals. Traffic signal heads usually suspended on wires or temporary wooden poles. . they are used as an alternative to permemnt signals during construction and must be approved by the road authroity. Pilot and pace vehicles Both must be approved by the road authorities. Pilot vehicles There are to ensure that motorists are driving are driving at a reduced speed and via the safest route and provide more specific guidance for the motorists. Pace vehicles This ensures motorists are guided through the work area at reduced speeds. Paid duty police officers (section 4.4.5) When authority is needed to enforce laws in a work zone a paid duty police officer will be used. Paid duty police officers are required to direct traffic within 30 meters of an intersection with temporary or permanent traffic signals. Paid duty police officers may also be used as pace or pilot vehicles. book 7 section 4.4.6 table 4.10 and 4.11 Positive protection This makes use of devices that protect the work area from approaching traffic that has failed to make the proper preparations after travelling through the active advance warning . They may also offer some sort of extra protection for traffic travelling through the work zone. Buffer vehicles Placed upstream of the work zone to prevent out of control vehicles entering the work zone. It will be unoccupied and may have an attenuator attached to a truck or trailer. Glare screens These must be placedc in a way that does not obstruct motorists view and are designed to reduce opposing traffic headlights. Barriers Designed to protect workers and other road users they are dependent on proper and careful placement. These are required under the conditions set out in the regulations for construction projects. Temporary concrete barriers Installed according to the Ontario roadside safety manual and must meet the specifications set out by the Ontario provincial standard specifications (OPSS) and be installed according to the Ontario roadside safety manual. Moveable barriers Must be approved by the road authority and are usually sectional barriers linked together and placed by a vehicle. Ballast filled barriers These must be approved by the road authority, they are steel and plastic filled with water and sand and can only be used in urban areas where speed is low. Barrier end treatments Placed at the end of barriers to reduce impact severity and must meet requirements of OPSS and the Ontario roadside safety manual. Mobile barriers Modular units pulled by a truck trailer. Set up in right or left configurations and must be equipped with an attenuator. Must be approved by the road authority. Vehicle arresting systems Portable wire or netting systems that must be approved by the road authority. Truck or trailer mounted attenuators Must mee the requirements of the national cooperative highway research program (NCHRP) A device mounted on a truck or trailer to absorb impacts. Temporary transverse rumble strips Placed in sets of three at a 90 degree angle they are designed to make an audible noise and vibration to alert drivers to up coming road work. Device inspection (section 4.1 book 7) Checking equipment Section 25 (1) (b) Of the OSHA states that the equipment, materials and protective devices provided by the employer are maintained in good condition. the responsibility lies with the contractor to make sure these devices meet the standards set out. Devices should be checked as follows: While in storage. While in preparation for drop off at a work zone. During installation. Regularly during the course of work. Quality ranges There are 3 ranges of acceptability that traffic control devices will fall into. It is important that these devices are checked regularly and meet specifications to ensure the safety of the work area. Acceptable These devices meet all requirements and can be used in any work zone. Each type of device should be at least 50% acceptable ie 50% of cones or barrels. Marginal At or the lower end of acceptable, use should not exceed 50% and they should be evenly mixed with acceptable devices in the work area. Unacceptable Not to be used as they do not meet standards, replace or repair within 12 hours of discovery or notification. Device acceptability images The most relevant are the cones and stop/slow signs. ![[cones acceptability.png]] ![[signs acceptability.png]] All TC-21 traffic control person ahead and TC-22 Traffic control signs must meet the acceptable criteria.","title":" Traffic Control Methods"},{"location":"TC%20methods.html#traffic-control-methods","text":"","title":"Traffic control methods"},{"location":"TC%20methods.html#channelization-guidance-and-info","text":"The methods used should guide the public, control traffic flow and positively protect workers.

In no way retaliate, threaten or punish the employee for bringing the complaint to his attention. Working to find a resolution The supervisor and employer shall work together to find a resolution that works for the employee. At this point the investigation will be recorded and tracked no matter the findings. This will show that diligence is taken to resolve issues and allow the employer to have a record of the findings should the issue arise again.

This may involve correcting the hazard, condition, or altering the activity to remove the danger or providing protection to individuals at risk. (b) If immediate correction or protection is not possible, the Head can issue a written directive to the employer, instructing them not to use the place, machine, thing, or perform the activity until the issue is resolved. However, the directive doesn't prohibit necessary actions for complying with the Head's directions. Prohibited disciplinary action Section 147: No employer shall: Dismiss, suspend, lay off, or demote an employee. Impose a financial or other penalty on an employee. Refuse to pay an employee remuneration for a period they would have worked, if not for exercising their rights under Part 2.

If you need to exit for safety reasons (such as a fire), make sure you follow these steps: Remove any loose-fitting clothing. You need to make sure that when you exit the vehicle, no part of your body or your clothing is touching the vehicle and the ground at the same time. Jump. With the door open, prepare to jump by tucking your elbows into your stomach and keeping your hands clasped close to your chest. Jump out and away from the vehicle, making sure that you land with your feet together. You must not stumble, so don't try to jump far. Just travel a couple of feet so you can make sure you're not touching the vehicle. Shuffle. Move away from the vehicle, using the shuffle technique.","title":"When inside the vehicle."},{"location":"downed%20power%20lines.html#the-shuffle-step-technique","text":"Quote To shuffle safely, your feet need to be close together and always touching so that the heel of the front foot doesn\u2019t extend past the toes of the back foot.

Working with cables requires being close to power lines at times. The danger of these power lines is the high voltage that employees can be exposed to. This danger comes in two forms: The space around the powerline. Direct contact with the line. The space around power lines. The danger of getting close to power lines is that the electricty can arc to a conductor like a ladder or a truck. This danger is increased as the voltage gets higher. To mitigate this there are minimum distances that need to be adhered to.

Of these, 53 were due to electrocution (non-intentional death caused by contact with electricity) or by the effects of electrical burns. This highlights the importance of being aware of electrical hazards in the workplace. In order to protect ourselves from the dangers of electricity, we should: Recognize the hazards associated with electricity. Understand the principles of electrical safety. Be familiar with the safety hazards associated with specific electrical equipment and appliances. Follow all safety procedures when working with or near electrical equipment and appliances. What is electricity? Electricity is the flow of charged particles (electrons or protons) through a material or space that is facilitated by a pushing force. We can measure that flow by attributing values to the flows properties. The basics of electricity All materials are made up of building blocks called atoms and within these atoms there are charged particles. the proton. the electron. Voltage this is the force that pushes the charged particles to create a flow. Because the particles are charged, having an abundance of one type of charge will cause them to seek a neutral charge. The particles push away from each other with great force. Electrical flow There are three components to the measurement of electrical flow. The measurement of flow. The force driving the flow The resistance of the material to that flow. The measurement of electrical flow. The Coulomb The coulomb is the charge created by the following number of particles. The important part in this instance is the number of the particles. The Ampere The movement of one * coulomb past a single point in one second. The Ampere is such a large number of particles that it is common to divide it into smaller units like the milliamp, which is 1000th of the Amp. The force driving the flow Flow is driven by the electrical fields of particles pushing away like charged particles. The closer the particles are to each other, the stronger the force pushing them apart will be. This is measured using the Volt. The resistance of the medium Each medium that is exposed to electrical flow has some sort of resistance to it. What determines the type of material is how readily under normal circumstances that material will resist the flow of electricity. Note The following terms are only applicable under certain conditions: all materials are conductive when the flow is so large that they go through dielectric breakdown and are permanently changed. This means that employees should understand that just because something is an insulator does not mean it will protect them under all circumstances. The safest solution is to avoid all contact where possible. Conductive materials Flow in a conductive material under normal circumstances is easily achieved and these materials are used to direct flow for the purpose of work. Examples include metals, aluminum ladders, water, damp or waterlogged basements and crawlspaces. Insulator materials Flow in insulators is not easy to achieve under normal circumstances and these materials are generally used to stop flow for protection or controlling the flow. Measuring resistance of a material The unit of measurement for electrical resistance is the ohm (\u03a9). One ohm of resistance is needed to allow one amp of current to flow through a conductor when one volt is applied. In the cable industry Coaxial cable is 75 Ohms. This means that in order to get one amp of current flow through a set length of coaxial cable, we would need to apply a voltage of 75 volts. Ohms law Ohms law is used to calculate the resistance, voltage and amperage in an electrical circuit. It states that the current in a circuit is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance. This law can be used to calculate any of these values if the other two are known.","title":"The fundamentals"},{"location":"electrical%20safety%20fundamentals.html#why-we-need-to-be-safe-around-electricity","text":"In the past ten years, there have been 142 electrical fatalities in Ontario.

PPE is equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards. Examples of PPE include gloves, safety glasses, hearing protection, hard hats, and respirators. When employees use PPE, employers should implement a PPE program. While elements of the PPE program depend on the work process and the identified PPE, the program should address: workplace hazards assessment. PPE selection and use. inspection and replacement of damaged or worn-out PPE. employee training. program monitoring for continued effectiveness. PPE should only be used when there is no way to implement more effective measures or while more effective measures are being put in place. Wearing PPE does not prevent you from being exposed to the hazard, so care should be taken to manage your actions for maximum safety. Administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE). These are often used when employers are in the process of implementing other control methods from the hierarchy. Additionally, administrative controls and PPE are often applied to existing processes where hazards are not well controlled. PPE HARD HATS Hard hats are required when working in areas where there is a potential for injury to the head from falling objects. In addition, hard hats designed to reduce electrical shock are required when working near exposed electrical conductors that may contact the head or induce a current in the employee that may travel through the span to ground. Hard hat standards. Refer to CSA Standard Z94.1-15 \"Industrial protective headwear Class of hat Class E (20 000 V electrical rating) - provides head protection against high voltage conductors Class G (2200 V electrical rating) - provides head protection against low voltage conductors (general trades) Class C (no electrical rating) Hard hat components. The hard hat is made up of a shell and a suspension system. Inspection of the hard hats shell. This should be done before every use. Inspect and replace a shell that shows signs of wear, scratches or gouges. Shells exposed to heat, sunlight, UV light and chemicals can become stiff or brittle. A visible pattern of tiny cracks may develop. Over time, weathered hats can become dull in colour or have a chalky appearance. Report to your supervisor when any of the above signs of wear start to appear. Report to your supervisor when your hard hat has been struck, even if no damage is visible. Report to your supervisor if the hard hats protective abilities are in doubt. Care of the hard hat shell Do not transport headwear in rear windows of vehicles. Heat and UV light (including sunlight) can damage the material, making it brittle and less protective. Inspect headwear before each use. Do not use accessories on the hard hat. Do not wear baseball style hats under the headwear as it interferes with the suspension. Only wear the hard hat with the peak at the front. Insect repellant or other chemicals can degrade the headwear material. Keep these stored away from the hard hat. do not drill holes, alter or modify the shell. Alterations can severely affect the protection provided by the headwear. Do not paint the plastic shell. Paint solvents can make plastic headwear brittle and more susceptible to cracks. Paint can also hide cracks that may develop. Instead, use reflective marking tape to make numbers or symbols for identification purposes. Some headwear may be painted, but check with the manufacturer for approval. Do not use winter liners that contain metal or electrically conductive material under Class G or E headwear. Do not use metal labels as we work around electricity. The suspension The suspension system is as important as the shell. It holds the shell away from the head and acts as a shock-absorber. It also holds the shell in place on the head and allows air to flow freely. Proper suspension fit. Adjust headband size so that headwear will stay on when the wearer is bending over, but not so tight that it leaves a mark on the forehead. Inspection of the suspension. Ensure that the suspension is in good condition. The main purpose of the suspension is to absorb energy. Look closely for cracked or torn adjustment slots, frayed material or other signs of wear such as dents, cuts, or gouges. Check the suspension lugs (tabs) carefully. Long periods of normal use can damage the suspension. Perspiration, hair oils, dirt, insecticides, hair sprays and hair treatments can speed up the deterioration of suspension materials. Replace the suspension if it has torn or broken threads. Only use liners if approved by manufacturer. Do not put anything between the suspension and the shell. There must be a clearance inside the headwear while it is being worn. In case of a blow to the head, that space helps absorb the shock. Do not use a suspension made by one manufacturer with products made by another manufacturer. Do not change or alter any of the suspension, liner or shell. SAFETY GLASSES Common hazards The most common hazards to the eyes and face are: - dust and dirt blown around by the wind; - tree branches; - flying particles from drilling, cutting, digging and other similar operations; - fibres from insulating materials, such as fibreglass; - Wires themselves escpecially when working with wires above eye level. Standards Glasses should follow standard CSA Standard Z94.3-02 Checking the glasses before wearing them.

This is a provision enacted in 1978 that allows an employee to withdraw from work and initiate the formal investigation of a dangerous situation. It is essential that managers and supervisors be aware of the broad scope and impact of the current definition of danger and the right to refuse dangerous work. In addition, labour relations officers who may be involved in refusal-to-work situations, and occupational health and safety staff who may be asked to provide advice on perceived situations of danger, must also be aware of the implications of its definition and the scope of the right to refuse dangerous work. Additional explanation of danger can be found in Chapter 2 . The definition of danger. \u201cDanger\u201d means any existing or potential hazard or condition or any current or future activity that could reasonably be expected to cause injury or illness to a person exposed to it before the hazard or condition can be corrected, or the activity altered, whether or not the injury or illness occurs immediately after the exposure to the hazard, condition or activity, and includes any exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to result in a chronic illness, in disease or in damage to the reproductive system. The definition of safety. \u201cSafety\u201d is defined as \u201cprotection from danger and hazards arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of employment.\u201d The grounds for a refusal. if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that: the use or operation of the machine or thing constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee; a condition exists in the place that constitutes a danger to the employee; or the performance of the activity constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee. They may initiate the investigation of a dangerous situation. An employee cannot refuse to use or operate a machine or thing, refuse to work in a place, or refuse to perform an activity. 1. If the refusal puts the life, health or safety of another person directly in danger. 2. The danger is a normal condition of employment. Reporting the danger. An employee who refuses to work under the right-to-refuse provision or who is prevented from acting in accordance with the provision must report the circumstances of the matter to the employer without delay. The person to whom the report is made is likely to be the employee\u2019s manager or supervisor. The manager or supervisor receiving the report should be fully aware of their responsibilities in investigating the circumstances of the refusal and of the rights of the employee making the report. The process. If not resolved immediately this could involve members of the work place health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, or eventually a health and safety officer of HRSDC\u2019s Labour Program. Where a report is made under the above provision, the employee, if there is a collective agreement in place that provides for a redress mechanism in circumstances described in section 128, must inform the employer in a timely manner whether the employee intends to exercise recourse under the agreement or this section. The selection of recourse is irrevocable unless the employer and employee agree otherwise. This requirement is intended to resolve problems where collective agreements contain refusal-to-work provisions that can cause considerable delays if the choice of process is not declared early and \u201clocked in\u201d for the duration of the refusal. The employers duty after a report. If the employer agrees there is danger he shall take immediate action to protect the employees and notify the health and safety committee of the action to be taken. In this case the committee need not investigate and the committee will be informed of the actions. Managers and supervisors. Should make every effort possible to identify the reason for the reported refusal and resolve the concern by taking immediate action to protect the employee. Continued refusal to work if the situation is not resolved. Without delay, the employee must report the circumstances of the matter to the employer and to the work place committee (the committee) or the health and safety representative (the representative) (subsection 128(9)). Immediately on being informed of an employee\u2019s continued refusal, the employer (or a representative of) must investigate the matter in the presence of the employee who reported it and in the presence of (subsection 128(10)): at least one member of the work place committee who does not exercise managerial functions; the health and safety representative; or if no person is available under paragraph ( a ) or ( b ), at least one person from the work place who is selected by the employee. If, and only if, an employee member of the committee or a representative is not readily available to participate in the investigation, the refusing employee can select another employee from that work place to be present to participate in the investigation. If more than one employee has made a report of a similar nature, those employees may designate one employee from among themselves to be present at the investigation. This provision is intended to resolve situations where multiple refusals have a labour relations rather than a health and safety objective (subsection 128(11)). Departments need to ensure that employees, managers and supervisors are aware of this provision, and that those employees involved are also aware of their right to designate one of them to represent their interests. the employee does not need to be present for the investigation to proceed if the employee wishes to be absent. The investigation of the danger can still proceed (subsection 128(12)) and should be documented in case a complaint is made to a health and safety officer. The health and safety officer. At this point the employer can, if the employee still does not agree with the actions taken, invoke the presence of a health and safety officer. The employer must inform the committee or the representative of any steps taken by the employer under subsection 128(13). Payment and alternative work. Unless otherwise provided in a collective agreement or other agreement, employees are to be paid for the period of the work stoppage, or to the end of the shift, if they are unable to perform their work as the result of another employee\u2019s refusal to work, or if alternative work is not available. With the collective agreements in place in the public service, this has not been an issue and is not expected to become one (subsection 128.1(1)). The next shift. Where there has been a stoppage of work arising from application of the right to refuse and if alternative work is not available, employees scheduled to work on the next shift must be given at least one hour\u2019s notice not to attend work. Alternate work. An employer may assign reasonable alternative work to employees who are deemed to be at work under subsection (1) or (2) above. This provision provides managers or supervisors with the authority to assign alternative work to all or some employees affected by a work refusal (subsection 128.1(3)). Unjustified refusal. Employees affected by a work stoppage under a refusal to work may be required to repay wages and benefits paid during the period of \u201cunjustified refusal\u201d because another employee unjustifiably refused to work. After the employee has exhausted all avenues of redress, this provision applies unless a collective agreement or other agreement provides otherwise. The investigation by the Officer. Those present in the investigation. The investigation will take place in the presence of the employer of the employee and one other person who is an employee member of the work place committee, a representative or, in the absence of the above persons, another employee from the work place designated by the employee. If the investigation involves more than one employee, those employees may in turn designate one employee from among themselves to be present at the investigation. However, a health and safety officer may proceed with an investigation in the absence of any person mentioned above if that person chooses not to be present or is unable to attend. Prior to the investigation by an officer. Before the health and safety officer\u2019s investigation and decision, the employer may require that the employee concerned remain at a safe location near the place in respect of which the investigation is being made. The employer can also assign the employee reasonable alternative work (subsection 129(5)) but cannot assign any other employee to perform the refusing employee\u2019s work unless: the other employee is qualified for the work; the other employee has been advised of the refusal of the employee concerned and of the reasons for the refusal; and the employer is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the other employee will not be put in danger. Notification of results by the officer. A health and safety officer shall, on completion of an investigation made under this section, decide whether the danger exists and shall immediately give written notification of the decision to the employer and the employee. This is important in that the notification of the decision on the existence of danger shall be in writing and before the officer leaves the work place (subsection 129(4)). If a health and safety officer decides that the danger exists, the officer shall issue the directions that the officer considers appropriate. An employee may continue to refuse to work until the directions are complied with or until they are varied or rescinded (subsection 129(6)). If the employer disagrees with the decision. The employer may appeal to an appeals officer authorised to determine if an appeal is warranted. If an employee disagrees with the decision. If a health and safety officer decides that there is no danger, the employee is not to continue to refuse to work. However, the employee, or a person designated by the employee, may appeal the decision in writing to an appeals officer within 10 days after receiving notice of the decision (subsection 129(7)). The employee and the officers findings. The refusing employee or employees may continue to refuse to perform the task in question or refuse to work in that location until the direction is complied with or amended by the appeals officer. These employees are entitled to refuse only the task in question; they are not entitled under the law to go home. The manager or supervisor should assign alternative work if at all possible. Under certain circumstances, if the decision of danger clearly relates to the employee and the employee\u2019s ability to do the job, the job may be assigned to another employee under the same conditions as specified in subsection 129(5). If the officer is wrong about the danger. In instances where a decision of no danger by a health and safety officer may be wrong and an employee may in fact still be at risk, an appeals officer most likely will give priority to these types of appeals over employer appeals of directions. Prohibited disciplinary action. As for the internal complaint resolution process. No employer shall dismiss, suspend, lay off or demote an employee, impose a financial or other penalty on an employee, or refuse to pay an employee remuneration in respect of any period of time that the employee would have worked, or take any disciplinary action against, or threaten to take any such action against, an employee because the employee: has testified or is about to testify in a proceeding taken or an inquiry held under this Part; has provided information to a person engaged in the performance of duties under this Part regarding the conditions of work affecting the health or safety of the employee or of any other employee of the employer; or has acted in accordance with this Part or has sought the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Part. It is important for managers and supervisors to note that the complaint can be with respect to any prohibited action, especially that in paragraph ( c ) above, not just disciplinary or discriminatory action resulting from a disputed refusal to work. Complaints when there is action against employees. This is a very significant and important provision in that a complaint may be made in writing to the Public Service Labour Relations Board (the Board) with respect to any disciplinary or prohibited discriminatory action (section 147), not merely those related to refusals to work. In addition to being a prohibition enforceable through the courts, a complaint can be made to the Board by the employee, and the Board can hear the complaint under its own rules of procedure. Furthermore, a person designated by the employee for that purpose could make the complaint on the employee\u2019s behalf. Although an employee may contact a lawyer, the strong likelihood is that this other person will be an experienced union official or employee representative. The impact could be significant if supervisors are not aware of the prohibition and the possible consequence of taking such action.","title":"the right to refuse work"},{"location":"refusal%20to%20work.html#the-refusal-to-work-process","text":"This is a provision enacted in 1978 that allows an employee to withdraw from work and initiate the formal investigation of a dangerous situation.
